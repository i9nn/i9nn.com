# i9nn.com
i9nn.com is a project of mine that has gone through a series of cosmetic and code changes that have allowed me to more cohesively understand the basics and nuances of CSS and HTML, with a tiny little bit of JavaScript in there, too. It's been a fantastic project to work on and is my first actual website build, which is crazy to think about!
